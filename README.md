# **Tender Data Scraper**

This project is a web scraper built with Python, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup. It automatically navigates to the "New Tenders" section of a government tender site, selects "All" tenders, sets the dropdown to display 20 results, and extracts tender details from the first two pages. The data is then saved into a CSV file.
